# Hello-world
learning GitHub stuff

yerrrr

Arijan Hasanaj will be one of the most influencial entreprenuers on the planet 
He will also be one of the few to have visited the moon before his last day on earth 

I honestly just want to learn how to code so i can create a few projects and see if they are actually valuable and useful. i want to be able to make peoples lives a little bit better everyday, through my creativity and work, if possible
